    <h1>French Macarons</h1>
    <p>The French Macarons is unique and A macaron is in every way more visual appealing than the cupcake. 
        It looks heavy and cute with two crusty, perfectly shaped round meringue based layers which have fillings sandwiched in the center. 
        The smooth texture of the outer crust made of almond flour and sugar is smooth and appealing.</p>

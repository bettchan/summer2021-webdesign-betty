<h1>Why do I like this hobby?</h1> 
<h2>The reason I like making macarons is because it's the eye-catching array of colors. </h2>
<h2>The macaron draws me in because a macaron is in every way more visually appealing than the cupcake.</h2> 
<h2>It looks heavy and cute with two crusty, perfectly shaped round meringue based layers which have fillings sandwiched in the center.</h2> 
<h2>The smooth texture of the outer crust made of almond flour and sugar is smooth and appealing.</h2> 
<h2>A burst of bold flavor from the filling ties it all together. And it makes me want to try the next one and the next one. </h2>

<p>Next, I will show you to make macaron we need the following ingredients</p>

<h1>MACARONS INGREDIENTS</h1>
<ul><li>1 ¾ cups powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 cup almond flour, finely ground</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
<li>3 egg whites, at room temperature</li>
<li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>3 tablespoon whole milk</li></ul>

<ol>
<p><strong>Step 1 
Prepare the Macarons: Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, until loose peaks form. Gradually add granulated sugar, and beat until sugar is dissolved and stiff peaks form.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 2 
Swift powdered sugar and almond flour through a fine mesh strainer. Fold flour mixture into whipped egg whites. Add food coloring until desired color is reached.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 3 
Transfer mixture to a ziplock plastic bag or piping bag with a rounded tip. Pipe 1-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and let stand in a dry place until rounds are dry to the touch, 1 to 2 hours.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 4
Bake in a preheated oven until ruffled edges (also called “feet”) have formed and macarons are set and not jiggly, 10 to 12 minutes.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 5 
Prepare the Filling: While macarons bake, beat together salt, powdered sugar, butter, and milk with an electric mixer on medium until fully combined and smooth. Transfer filling to a piping bag.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 6
Remove macarons from the oven, and let cool on a baking sheet set on a wire drying rack for 15 minutes, then transfer macarons directly to wire rack and continue cooling. Pipe or spread Filling onto 1 macaron, and top with a similar size macaron. Serve immediately or store in an air-tight container for up to 2 days.

<h3>Finally, I want to share tips for a perfect batch of french macarons.</h3>
<li>I know that making macarons can be a challenging task, but with my tips and recipes, I believe you’ll be a macaron master in no time!</li> 
<li>When separating the eggs, make sure no yolk gets into the whites.</li>
<li>Do not under- or over whip the meringue. Make sure it has smooth, shiny, stiff peaks. </li>
<li>Make sure you sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together, so the sugar absorbs any excess oil from the almonds.</li>
<li>when mixing the macaron batter, make sure you go slowly so you don’t risk overmixing it. </li>
<li>Let the piped macarons rest at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours if necessary, to develop a skin & ensure no cracks form.</li>
